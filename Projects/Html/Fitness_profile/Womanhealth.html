				How to: Start standing with feet under hips and arms bent, fingertips resting behind head, elbows wide. Without changing shape of upper body, hinge at hips and lower torso toward floor until chest is parallel to mat. Then push through feet, squeeze glutes, and reverse the movement to return to start. That’s one rep. Do four sets of 12 to 15 reps, rest for a minute, then continue to your next move.For the bodyweight version of the good morning stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your hands placed behind your head. Stand upright, brace your core and pull your shoulders back. Take a breath and hinge forwards from your hips, not your waist, allowing a slight bend in your knees but keeping your back flat. Lean forwards until you feel a slight stretch in your hamstrings (but don’t go beyond horizontal), then, as you exhale, reverse the move to stand up straight.To incorporate a resistance band into the move, stand on a large looped band with both feet and bring the other side of the loop over your head so it rests on your shoulders.
				When you progress to using a light barbell rest it across the back of your shoulders, not your neck. Hold the bar in place with both hands and perform the exercise as in the bodyweight version. Keep a tight grip on the bar, pulling it into the soft muscle of your shoulders as you lean forwards so it doesn’t put pressure on your neck.Whatever version of the good morning you are doing, make sure you avoid craning your neck to look forwards as you lean forwards. Instead, keep a neutral spine by looking forwards as you stand and towards the floor as you lower. Push your hips back to maintain balance and drive them forwards to initiate the force needed to return to standing.

			How to: Start standing with feet hip-width apart, arms reaching toward floor, with hands holding weights against thighs and palms facing body. Pull elbows wide and up to slightly above shoulders, so hands reach chest height, then return to start. That’s one rep. Do 15 to 20 reps then continue immediately on to your next move. (Remember: You're doing five total.) After you finish your last exercise, rest for up to two minutes, then start over from the top for a total of two or three rounds.How to: Start standing with feet hip-width apart, arms reaching toward floor, with hands holding weights against thighs and palms facing body.
