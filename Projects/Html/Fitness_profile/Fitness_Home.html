						<p>With over 12 years experience, I understand that sometimes life just gets in the way. Before you know it, you are out of shape, lack motivation, energy, can’t do the things you used to and are now heavier, unhealthier and missing that spark. It’s not your fault; health and fitness is usually the first thing to be put on the back burner when other life stresses get in the way.

				<p class="small" style="font-family:cursive; font-size:15px;line-height:normal;margin-bottom:0px; ;">Loose your weight Not ur Mind.When you lose weight too quickly, you lose fat and muscle. Muscle burns kilojoules, but fat doesn't. So, when you stop dieting and return to your usual habits, your body will burn even fewer calories than before because the relative amount of muscle in your body has decreased and your metabolic rate is slower.</p><br>
				<h1 class="big" style="font-size:30px;">Cardiovascular Training</h1><br>
				<p class="small" style="font-family:cursive;font-size:15px;">Cardiovascular exercise is any vigorous activity that increases heart rate and respiration and raises oxygen and blood flow throughout the body while using large muscle groups of the body repetitively and rhythmically.</p><br>
				<h1 class="big" style="font-size:30px;">Muscular Development & Training</h1><br>
				<p class="small"style=" font-family:cursive;font-size:15px;">Muscular strength relates to your ability to move and lift objects. It’s measured by how much force you can exert and how much weight you can lift for a short period of time.Examples of exercises that develop muscular strength and power include resistance training, such as weightlifting, bodyweight exercises, and res istance band exercises. Running, cycling, and climbing hills are also options.Read on to learn more about the difference between muscular strength and muscular endurance, as well as muscular strength benefits, cautions, and exercises.</p>

				By the time she was 28, Stacy Blair was already beginning to have health problems due to her weight.
				"I was taking medication for high blood pressure, my asthma was getting worse, and it was physically painful to walk or stand for more than five minutes," Blair told Women's Health in October.For the first time in her life, she was motivated to lose weight not for the sake of looking good, but for personal wellness and improving her health—an approach that changed everything."I wanted to be able to play an active role in my little brothers' lives rather than watching from the couch," she said. "I wanted to be able to be a mom one day. I wanted to be able to move without being in pain. I wanted to live instead of just exist."Blair got started by counting calories and keeping a daily log of her meals, which led to her going on a keto diet that helped her lose 220 pounds in 17 months."At the end of the day when everything is all said and done, it's not about the weight you lose, it's about the life you gain," she said.

				Kevin Gendreau, MD, 31, wrestled with a food addiction for more than a decade, and was 306 pounds at his heaviest."I was diagnosed with high blood pressure, hypertension, high cholesterol, fatty liver disease, and sleep apnea, among other things," Gendreau told Best Life in October. "I knew they were all because of my eating habits, but I just couldn't stop."But when his sister was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 2016, it became a wake-up call for him to make his physical health a priority. "What she was going through wasn't her choice," he said. "What I was doing to myself was."By cutting out all the junk food and replacing it with a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, nuts, and protein, Gendreau lost 125 pounds in 18 months."The best advice that I can give is to find a motivation to change," he said. "For me, it was my sister getting sick and needing to be there for her kids, but it could be anything. Once you find that reason and commit to it, you're good to go."

			Think it's too late to change your body once you're over 50? Think again. In October, 73-year-old Joan MacDonald became an internet inspiration after showing off her incredible transformation."For many decades, I was more often overweight than at a healthy weight," MacDonald told The Daily Mail. "I was on medication for high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and acid reflux. My arthritis was acting up pretty bad."Concerned about her health, MacDonald's daughter taught her mom how to use her iPhone to track her meals and exercise activity. That tool helped drive her to eat more protein and healthy fats, and go to the gym four or five days a week. And after making those major changes to her lifestyle, MacDonald lost 55 pounds in a year, gained plenty of muscle, and now helps others reach their fitness goals, no matter how old they are."For those who truly feel at a loss, I'd say change one thing with your food intake, one exercise to do, and each week add something new," she said. "Don't expect miracles right away, take it slow and steady but keep building."

				Twenty-five percent of your daily nutritional intake should ideally come from healthy proteins found naturally (no shakes or powders please!). To begin with, let’s understand the TEF or Thermic Effect of Food, which is caused when you eat. The body uses its extra calories to process and digest this food. Of all the food groups, protein contains the highest TEF, potentially bringing it up to a whopping 30 percent, which is ten times more than the maximum of 3 per cent that fats offer.Protein is also a filling option, particularly animal sources of protein, so this prevents binge fests on unhealthy offerings, and makes sure your tummy feels satisfied in a good way. Protein is also a key nutrient in muscle-building, so when you take in a protein-rich diet, it helps convert fat to muscle, which in turn increases metabolism. So you’ll eat less, burn more, and stay strong – a win-win situation from every angle.

				<b>Carbohydrates</b>
			</div>
			<div class="nutritiondietplan column10">
				Carbohydrates are found in a wide array of both healthy and unhealthy foods—bread, beans, milk, popcorn, potatoes, cookies, spaghetti, soft drinks, corn, and cherry pie. They also come in a variety of forms. The most common and abundant forms are sugars, fibers, and starches.Foods high in carbohydrates are an important part of a healthy diet. Carbohydrates provide the body with glucose, which is converted to energy used to support bodily functions and physical activity. But carbohydrate quality is important; some types of carbohydrate-rich foods are better than others:The healthiest sources of carbohydrates—unprocessed or minimally processed whole grains, vegetables, fruits and beans—promote good health by delivering vitamins, minerals, fiber, and a host of important phytonutrients.Unhealthier sources of carbohydrates include white bread, pastries, sodas, and other highly processed or refined foods.  These items contain easily digested carbohydrates that may contribute to weight gain, interfere with weight loss, and promote diabetes and heart disease.The Healthy Eating Plate recommends filling most of your plate with healthy carbohydrates – with vegetables (except potatoes) and fruits taking up about half of your plate, and whole grains filling up about one fourth of your plate.

			<b>Vegetables</b> are full of essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that provide many important health benefits to your body. For instance, carrots are known for being very high in vitamin A, which plays an important role in eye health, as you grow older. 
			
			<p>Improved Digestive Health</p>

			Vegetables are a good source of dietary fiber, a type of carbohydrate that helps pass food through your digestive system. Studies show that fiber may also improve vitamin and mineral absorption in the body, which could potentially raise your daily energy levels.

			<p>Lower Blood Pressure</p>

			Many green leafy vegetables like kale, spinach, and chard contain potassium. Potassium helps your kidneys filter sodium out of your body more efficiently, which can reduce your blood pressure.

			<p>Lower Risk of Heart Disease</p>

			Green leafy vegetables also contain vitamin K, which is believed to prevent calcium from building up in your arteries. This can lower your risk of arterial damage and help prevent many heart health complications in the future.

			<p>Diabetes Control</p>

			Vegetables are particularly high in fiber, which is needed for optimal digestion. They have a low glycemic index, so your blood sugar won’t rise quickly after a meal. The American Diabetes Association recommends at least 3 to 5 servings per day of non-starchy vegetables like broccoli, carrots, or cauliflower.

				Fruits are a good source of vitamins and minerals, recognized for their role in preventing vitamin C and vitamin A deficiencies. People who incorporate fruits and vegetables as part of a healthy eating pattern have a reduced risk of some chronic diseases. USDA's MyPlate encourages filling half of the plate with fruits and vegetables at mealtimes.Fruits are an important part of a healthy eating pattern and the source of many vital nutrients, including potassium, folate (folic acid), and antioxidants including polyphenols. Fruit such as blueberries, cranberries, strawberries and citrus also contain phytochemicals that are being studied for their added health benefits.
